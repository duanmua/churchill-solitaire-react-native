# Churchill Solitaire React Native

[Inspired by the app](http://churchillsolitaire.com)

This project was created because I wanted to become more familiar with React Native, and I find the existing Churchill Solitaire app UX to be frustrating.

### Differences From Regular Solitaire
* 2 Decks
* 10 lanes dealt in mirrored stacks
* A click on the deck deals cards directly onto all lanes that aren't a properly ordered stack starting with a King on an empty slot
* HARDER

### Demo (with some struggles)

### TODO
* Info on project setup & running the tests
